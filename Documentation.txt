Overview:
  MessageQueueApp class simulates a message-driven application using a producer-consumer pattern with a BlockingQueue for managing messages.
  It uses AtomicInteger to track and log the total number of messages processed successfully and errors encountered.
  Producers wait for user input to produce messages, which are then consumed by consumer threads.
